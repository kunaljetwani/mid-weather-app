      <h1>Welcome!, to our Weather Forecast App</h1>
      <p>Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to
        predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time.
        People have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and
        formally since the 19th century.</p>
      <p>
        Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the
        current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean and using meteorology to
        project how the atmosphere will change at a given place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once calculated manually based mainly upon changes in barometric
        pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition or cloud cover,
        weather forecasting now relies on computer-based models that take many
        atmospheric factors in account.
      </p>
      <p>Humans inputs is still required  to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon
        ,upon which involves pattern recoginiation skills, telleconnections,knowledge of model performance, and knowledge
        of model bases.
